# Time-Series-Forcasting-MLP-Project
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for time series forecasting using non-linear machine learning (NLLM) models. Time series forecasting is a crucial task across various domains such as finance, economics, weather prediction, and more. 
Welcome to the Time Series Forecasting with Non-Linear Machine Learning Models repository! This repository is designed to be a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing time series forecasting using non-linear machine learning (NLLM) models. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this repository aims to provide you with the knowledge and tools necessary to tackle time series forecasting tasks with confidence.
# Overview
Time series forecasting is a critical task in various domains such as finance, economics, weather prediction, and more. While traditional statistical methods like ARIMA have been widely used for time series forecasting, non-linear machine learning models offer the advantage of capturing complex temporal dependencies present in the data.

# In this repository, you'll find:
Implementation Examples: Practical code examples using popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn. Each example covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.
Model Selection: Comparison and explanation of different non-linear machine learning models suitable for time series forecasting, including RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, CNNs, and Transformer-based models.
Evaluation Metrics: Information on commonly used evaluation metrics for time series forecasting tasks, such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and more.
Model Selection: Comparison and explanation of different non-linear machine learning models suitable for time series forecasting, including RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, CNNs, Transformer-based models, Random Forest, and Linear Regression.
Case Studies: Real-world case studies demonstrating the application of non-linear machine learning models for forecasting various types of time series data, including financial markets, energy consumption, sales forecasting, and more
